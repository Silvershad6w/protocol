# TokenBnk Protocol 

**Pardon Our Dust** as we overhaul this protocol to deliver you a product that leaves all others *in the dust*


TokenBnk is the world's first Ethereum-based savings account to hold ether and ERC20 tokens. It leverages the intefaces from multiple tokenized asset protocols in order to offer an unprecendented level of interoperability for the storage of tokens that autonomously rewards users in the same base currency that they hold. Users interact with the RewardDAO contract in order to deploy their own Savings Contract, an isolated contract which holds their funds securely. The RewardDAO is hooked in to a decentralized network of Savings Contracts in order to facilitate the deposits and withdraws of users into their respective contracts. On top of this network is introduced the notion of user-based rewards which get distributed throughout the network whenever a user withdraws their funds and pay the withdrawal fee.
